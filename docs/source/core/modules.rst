Modules
==============================

Our environments follow mainly the PettingZoo Agent Environment Cycle games model (AEC), [PettingZoo]_. We have also been greatly influenced by [Flatland]_ environments library. 

We chose to adopt some of its design principles which we believe considerably improves the generality and usability of the created environments. 

Concretely, each functional component of the environments was separated into different modules, in order to enhance design freedom and broadness. 

This led to the definition of four key functional modules: Instance Generator, Observations Generator, Agent Selector and Rewards classes:

- `Instance Generation <Instance%20Generator/instance-generator.html>`_ - Module responsible for problem instance space definition, generation, and sampling. It allows fast exploration of new instance distributions and straightforward adoption of standard benchmark instance data;
- `Observations <Observations/observations.html>`_ - One important aspect of agent's training is their ability to retrieve useful information from the environment in order to act on it. Maintaining an independent customizable observation class, empowers feature engineering and observation space exploration, opening the possibility for the creation of more aware and capable agents;
- `Agent Selector <Agent%20Selector/agent-selector.html>`_ - Equivalent to [PettingZoo]_, the Agent Selector class controls the selection of the next agent that will interact with the environment, through the _next_agent method. 
- `Agent Rewards <Agent%20Reward/agent-reward.html>`_ - All agent's reward methods are defined in this class.

All information management and agents control is carried out by the `Environment <Environment/environment.html>`_.
